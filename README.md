How to find and delete duplicate files on Mac: Duplicate File Finder
Usually you'll have to move to a paid version for advanced features such as deleting duplicate folders, hidden files and similar functions. One of our favourite apps, and one with a good level of positive feedback from customers, is Gemini 2: The Duplicate Finder, that can be found for £19.99 on the UK App Store or $19.99 on the US Store.

While the name might be more in keeping with a dystopian sci-fi novel, the app is a powerful tool for your Mac.

Not only can it find doubles of any files on your hard drive, but it also searches external drives and cloud storage services such as Google Drive and Dropbox. All this is accompanied by the ability to immediately replace any accidentally deleted files.

All of the apps listed above will certainly clear up some space on your Mac, and you can always start with the free ones then move up to a paid version later if you find the features useful.
