How to find and delete duplicate files on Mac

We show how to clear valuable space by finding and deleting duplicate files which could be slowing down your Mac


Over time, our hard drives can accumulate a large collection of duplicate files that take up space and can even slow down the performance of a Mac. Finding and deleting them can be time-consuming if you try to do it one by one, so in this article we show you quicker ways to cleanse your system of these delinquent doppelg√§ngers.

Why do I have duplicate files?
In most cases these will be mistaken downloads (clicking on a link twice), music files that you've added to iTunes but which still have the originals stored on your disk, Mail attachments, or a number of other possibilities. Unless you're fastidious in the use of your Mac, duplicates are going to turn up one way or another.
